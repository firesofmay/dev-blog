## Background
[Fifth Elephant](https://fifthelephant.in/2014/) (organised by [hasgeek](https://hasgeek.com/)) is probably one of the best conferences focussed on Data in India (I am biased though as I am on the Editorial Panel that curates the talks :) I gave a talk on "How to build a Data Stack" at this years edition. It was well-received as many people came up to me after my talk and asked quite a few interesting questions about their stack. I build a Data stack at [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com/) and then [Inmobi](http://www.inmobi.com/). Now I am doing the same at [Helpshift](http://www.helpshift.com/). Each time, the same questions were asked but the answers were different due to context and the maturity of the data ecosystem. I have refined these learnings in the talk. Hope  you enjoy it. Send me any questions you have, as I am always curious of how people build their stack and the learnings from them.
