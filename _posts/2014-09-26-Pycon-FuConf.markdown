We have a busy next few weeks at [Helpshift](http://www.helpshift.com). In the upcoming few weeks, a bunch of Helpshift team members are attending and speaking at various events in Bangalore. We are attending [Pycon India 2014](http://in.pycon.org/2014/), [Functional Conf](http://functionalconf.com/), [Elasticsearch Bangalore Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ElasticSearch-Exploring-the-power-of-distribution/events/208390472/) and [AWS Executive Summit](http://aws.amazon.com/events/executive-summit-2014-india/). Phew! More details below.

## Pycon 2014
Personally, I have been attending Pycon India since the first edition so it is like a annual get-together with all my fellow Python geeks. We use [Python](http://www.python.org) at Helpshift for prototyping and validating ideas quickly. I have built quite a few apps on Django and I use Python and R for some quick data analysis. Fellow team member [Swaroop CH](http://www.swaroopch.com/) has also written one of the early and popular books on Python - ["A Byte of Python"](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/). It's available for [free download in several formats](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/#_download). So if you are getting started with Python, I highly recommend it. 

Given our involvement with Python and Pycon for last several editions, we are doing our bit by [sponsoring Pycon India 2014](http://in.pycon.org/2014/sponsors.html). It's our way of giving back to the awesome Python community. Watch for interesting talks by Kushal Das (Keynote), [Kiran Jonnalagadda](http://in.pycon.org/funnel/2014/255-auth-as-a-service-with-lastuser), [Ankit Daftery](http://in.pycon.org/funnel/2014/214-python-arduino-and-connected-objects) and Anand S(http://in.pycon.org/funnel/2014/165-faster-data-processing-in-python). Drop by the Helpshift sponsor booth and say hi. Who knows you might win a goodie.

[Pycon India 2014](http://in.pycon.org/2014/) will be held at Nimhans Convention Center, Bangalore on 27-28 September 2014.

## Functional Conference 2014
We use [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) quite heavily in our tech stack and it is our primary language for writing code at Helpshift [See Previous coverage here](https://engineering.helpshift.com/2014/Functional-Testing-Clojure/). We also use [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) for processing and receving multiple billions of events. As you can see we are a bit biased towards functional programming languages due to expressiveness, succintness and scalability (due to non-mutable data structures). Since we have a built a large production system on Clojure and Erlang, we wanted to share our experiences and hear from others as well. Three members from the Helpshift team will be speaking at the Functional conference. Their talks are linked below:

1. [Deep Dive Clojure Workshop (Full day)](http://booking.agilefaqs.com/functional-conf-2014#workshop-54-info) by Baishampayan Ghose 
2. [Purely functional data structures demystified (Talk)](http://confengine.com/functional-conf-2014/proposal/325/purely-functional-data-structures-demystified) by Mohit Thatte
3. [Writing and improving tail recursive functions (Talk)](http://confengine.com/functional-conf-2014/proposal/322/writing-and-improving-tail-recursive-functions) by Bhasker Kode

We are sponsoring Functional Conference as well. Come talk to us at the sponsor booth and win some goodies.

[Functional Conf](http://functionalconf.com/) will be held at Hotel Chancery Pavilion, Bangalore on 9-11 October 2014
